# Great Weather
When I moved to Stockholm in early 2018, it was very cooold. Especially compared to my old hometown Munich. But, when time passed by, we went into a really hot May. Most of my colleagues were sure that this is the hottest month of May they ever experienced. Well let's see what the data says.

## Where the data comes from
Temperature data was kindly provided by [Tutiempo.net](https://www.tutiempo.net). As you can see in the `getWeatherData` function, I fetched the tables directly from their html sites.
